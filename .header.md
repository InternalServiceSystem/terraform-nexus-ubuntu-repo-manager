# Ubuntu Repo Manager for Nexus

The current version of Nexus does not support multiple debian distributions in a single repository. This module creates proxy repos for the default used Ubuntu repositiories.

* base repo (ie bionic)
* updates
* security
* backports

For an example of this module in use, see [ISS Apt Nexus Terraform](https://github.com/InternalServiceSystem/iss-apt-nexus-terraform)

## Requirements

The nexus provider must be installed in your terraform plugins path. Download it from [datadrivers/terraform-provider-nexus](https://github.com/datadrivers/terraform-provider-nexus) and extract it to you `~/terraform.d/plugins` directory.
